# CSS

CSS is a language that can be used to add style to an [HTML](/wiki/HTML) page.


CSS is a styling language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It enhances the visual appearance of web pages, making them more engaging and user-friendly.

## Basic Syntax

CSS consists of selectors and declaration blocks. Selectors target HTML elements, while declaration blocks contain property-value pairs.

```css
selector {
    property: value;
    /* Additional properties */
}


Selectors
Selectors target specific HTML elements. Common types include:

* Element Selector: Targets HTML elements by their tag name (e.g., p for paragraphs).
* Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., .class-name).
* ID Selector: Targets elements with a specific ID attribute (e.g., #id-name).

## Properties
* CSS properties define the visual properties of elements. Some common properties include:

* Color: color property sets the text color.
Font: font-family, font-size, font-weight control the font properties.
* Background: background-color, background-image set the background properties.
* Margin and Padding: margin, padding define spacing around elements.
* Border: border sets border properties.

## Box Model
* The box model comprises content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding it is crucial for layout design.


## Cascading and Specificity
* CSS follows cascading rules, meaning styles are applied from top to bottom and can be overridden. Specificity determines which style takes precedence.

## Responsive Design
* Responsive design ensures web pages adapt to various screen sizes and devices. Techniques like media queries and flexible layouts are used.
